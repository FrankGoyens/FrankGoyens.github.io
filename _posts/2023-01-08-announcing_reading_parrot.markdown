# Announcing my new \"Reading Parrot\" mobile app!

I've been working on a new app that will make reading stories to your kids more fun.

The gist is that the app plays sound effects while you read. Sound effects like a tiger's roar, or a bicycle bell, or a police siren,...

I believe that there is a lot of potential, I will be using it myself at the very least. I often read stories to my children. And while they enjoy listening to them, having another way to make it more engaging would be great.

The app will be called "reading parrot" or "voorlees papegaai" in Dutch. The highest priority right now is to make a Dutch version so that I can use it myself when reading to my kids. When I release it on the app store I would've added support for English as well.

Speaking of releasing on app stores, initially it will be released for Android. It is likely to be released by the end of January, early February perhaps. A release on iOS will follow shortly after the initial growing pains have settled.

Feel free to contact me if you have questions or other feedback: [support@geeapp.com ][contact-me]

And here is also a sneak peak to how the app looks, (this might change before the actual release)
