For this first post I will give you a general idea on what content to expect.

So I've decided to start maintaining a blog because I got all these ideas and nowhere to put them. What's the point of keeping them to myself?

Also it would be convenient to report on the challenges I faced. Both for others and myself. I can then look at my own notes later, and others can find them using a search engine.

I plan on making posts about very technical programming insights. And also on the more human side of programming. That's because software development usually happens in a team. A team working within the same code base makes for some interesting interactions. 

In my github repository I also maintain some open source projects in my [GitHub repo][frankgoyens-gh]. Please check it out if that's more your thing.

In my website description I mentioned that I work full-time with C++. I invite you to read the site description if you haven't already. When programmers think of C++ in this day and age, it's usually in an embedded context. But I actually implement fully fledged desktop applications for the metal construction industry.

Next to a software development role, I also have a software architect role. In that role I am relatively new. But I think people with the same ambitions will find that subject interesting as well. The most interesting aspect of being a software architect for me, is making design choices for the long term. 

That is in a nutshell what my content will be about.

Thank you for reading this first post! Please subscribe to the RSS feed to get notified for future posts. I don't plan to dissapoint!
