Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Frank Goyens, a software developer specializing in C++ and software architecture. Currently, I'm focused on making software solutions for the metalworking industry, specifically in processing and presenting data from CAD drawings and simulations.

But software isn't just my day job, it's also what I enjoy doing as a hobby. I love tinkering with hobby projects, whether it's creating mobile apps or game development. If you're curious about these projects, you'll find them on my website.

I also like to spend time with my family, to play games with my children. Other than that I like to read a book once in a while, and I practise martial arts.
