Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Frank Goyens, a software developer specializing in C++ and software architecture. Currently, I'm focused on making software solutions for the metalworking industry, specifically in processing and presenting data from CAD drawings and simulations.

But software isn't just my day job; it's also what I enjoy doing as a hobby. I love tinkering with hobby projects, whether it's creating mobile apps or game development. If you're curious about these projects, you'll find them on my website.

When I'm not glued to my computer screen, you might find me practicing Taekwondo or enjoying quality time with my children, playing games together.
