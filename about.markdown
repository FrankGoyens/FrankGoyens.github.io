Hello, my name is Frank Goyens. I am a medior C++ software developer. And a junior software architect.

I am passionate about coding and design. I work fulltime in the metal construction industry. In a nutshell: I process and display CAD drawings for simulation purposes. To complement the activities I do at my job. I also enjoy working on my own hobby projects. 

My mindset in the field of coding is all about the "meta-language". What I means by this is, for example, figuring out how well certain language features transfer to other languages. But this could also mean figuring out what language features not to use withing a specific language, this is especially good to know in C/C++.

My own projects can involve any kind of coding language or framework. I find it interesting trying out modern features of these languages and frameworks and comparing them to existing ones. I sometimes make a webserver app in Java or Python, static websites (like the one you're seeing right now). Desktop applications in C++, Python, C#. Mobile applications using Phonegap, Xamarin, Unity3D, ...
