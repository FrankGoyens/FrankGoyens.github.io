My name is Frank Goyens. Born on January 22, 1993. I am a professional C++ software engineer. And software architect.

I like to make posts here about insights that I gather at my fulltime job. And about software projects that I work on as a hobby. These projects can be virtually anything, though I have always been endeared by game making.
